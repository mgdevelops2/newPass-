# DIYpassword-challenge3

The site is a random password generator that follows criteria that creates a strong password that provides greater security. The criteria includes:
- length of password is at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
- user can confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters (at least one character type should be selected)

The password submitted will then be validated. When a password is generated that matches the selected criteria, then the password is written at the top of the page, if it does not match the criteria, an alert will be displayed at the top of the page.
