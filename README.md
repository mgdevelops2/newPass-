# Password Generator Starter Code



This is the main branch for my 3rd JS challenge

The idea here is to create a simple password generator. 
The passwod generator will take a few user inputs - one after the other.
- the prompts for user input
    - what length does the require? "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
        + the first prompt will as for a user input of a passLength, and then continue to another prompt. 
    - newPrompt1 will ask the user to check off if the password will include include <!-- numbers?  "0123456789" -->
        + If the user checks "true" to include numbers then var num will concatenate with the alphabet variable.
    - newPrompt1 will ask the user to check off if the password will include include  <!-- symbols? "!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[]^_`{|}~" -->
        + if the user checks "true" to include the symbols then var symbols will contatenate with the alphabet variable. 

- Once all the prompts have their required inputs
